# Mrrl's Trading Game

Running App: http://mrrl.de/  

Mrrl is a friendly murloc that is enslaved by the Naga in Nazjatar. When you meet him for the first time, 
he will be laying down on the floor, in very rough shape, and you decide it might be a good idea to bring 
him to the safety of the Ankoan/Unshackled base. Once you free Mrrl and escort him to safety, he shows 
his gratitude by summoning additional friends (Grrmrlg, Hurlgrl, Mrrglrlr and Flrgrrl) and becoming a 
vendor of murloc-themed items in Mezzamere or Newhome. [Neryssa, Wowhead]

## The idea

The idea is to shorten the time of Mrrl's game. The app is currently a simple calculator which calculates 
the price of each item. You start the day and look at Mrrl's item and enter the required items into the app. 
The app shows which items are needed and which dealer sells them.

## Further development

- automatic shopping list at daily reset
- Show item sold by Mrrl
- Mount alert
- better styling
