# Mrrl's Trading Game

Mrrl is a friendly murloc that is enslaved by the Naga in Nazjatar. When you meet him for the first time, 
he will be laying down on the floor, in very rough shape, and you decide it might be a good idea to bring 
him to the safety of the Ankoan/Unshackled base. Once you free Mrrl and escort him to safety, he shows 
his gratitude by summoning additional friends (Grrmrlg, Hurlgrl, Mrrglrlr and Flrgrrl) and becoming a 
vendor of murloc-themed items in Mezzamere or Newhome. [Neryssa, Wowhead]
